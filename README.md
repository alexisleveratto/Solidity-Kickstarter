# Solidity Kickstarter Project

This project is a basic implementation of a Kickstarter-like crowdfunding platform using Solidity, the primary programming language for Ethereum blockchain development.

## Description

The Solidity Kickstarter Project allows users to create and contribute to crowdfunding campaigns. Campaign creators can set a minimum contribution amount and a deadline. If the campaign doesn't meet its goal by the deadline, contributors can reclaim their funds. If the campaign is successful, the creator can request to withdraw the funds.
